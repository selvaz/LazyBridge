# Checkpoint & resume

Durable state for long-running plans. After every step (success or
fail) `Plan` writes its execution state to a `Store`; a re-run with
`resume=True` picks up at the failed step rather than re-running
the whole pipeline. Concurrent runs sharing a `checkpoint_key` are
serialised by compare-and-swap.

## Signature

```python
from lazybridge import Agent, Plan, Step, Store

Plan(
    *steps,
    store,                         # required for checkpointing
    checkpoint_key,                # required — unique key per run identity
    resume=False,                  # True → pick up at the failed step
    on_concurrent="fail",          # "fail" | "fork"
)


# Persisted shape at store[checkpoint_key]
{
    "next_step": "step_name" | None,
    "kv": {"writes_key": payload, ...},
    "completed_steps": [...],
    "status": "running" | "failed" | "done",
}


# Errors
ConcurrentPlanRunError             # CAS collision when on_concurrent="fail"
PlanCompileError                   # on_concurrent="fork" + resume=True (incompatible)
```

## Synopsis

`Plan` writes its state to `store[checkpoint_key]` after every step.
The persisted object captures three things:

- `next_step` — the name of the step the plan would run next. On
  success, this advances; on failure, it stays pointing at the
  failing step (or, for parallel bands, at the **band's first**
  step).
- `kv` — every step's `writes="key"` payload. This is what survives
  across runs; in-memory step history is rebuilt empty on resume.
- `completed_steps` + `status` — bookkeeping for the resume logic
  to decide what to skip.

Three states transitions:

- **Running** — `status="running"`, `next_step=<the next step>`.
  Normal progression after a successful step.
- **Failed** — `status="failed"`, `next_step=<failing step>` (or
  the parallel band's first step). A subsequent `resume=True` run
  retries from there.
- **Done** — `status="done"`, `next_step=None`. A subsequent
  `resume=True` short-circuits and returns an envelope whose
  payload is the cached `kv`.

`on_concurrent` controls what happens when two runs try to use the
same `checkpoint_key` at once:

- `"fail"` (default) — single-writer semantics. The second run
  raises `ConcurrentPlanRunError`. Pair with `resume=True` for
  crash recovery.
- `"fork"` — each run claims an isolated keyspace
  `f"{checkpoint_key}:{run_uid}"`. **Incompatible with
  `resume=True`** (raises `PlanCompileError` at construction). Use
  for fan-out workflows where many runs share the same plan
  shape.

## When to use it

- **Long-running pipelines.** Anything where re-running every step
  on failure costs real time or money. Crash-resume turns a
  one-step crash into a one-step retry.
- **Pipelines with expensive early steps and cheap late steps.**
  The classic shape: `extract` (slow ETL) → `transform` (fast) →
  `load` (fast). A failure in `load` shouldn't re-run `extract`.
- **Fan-out workflows on a shared store.**
  `on_concurrent="fork"` lets you run many variants of the same
  plan against the same Store without collisions.
- **Debugging in production.** A failed run leaves the partial
  state on disk. You can inspect `store.read("…")` keys before
  the resume run to understand what the pipeline saw at the
  failure point.

## When NOT to use it

- **Short, cheap pipelines.** A 3-step pipeline of LLM calls under
  a few seconds doesn't benefit from the persistence overhead.
- **Pipelines with no `writes=`.** Resume reconstructs from
  `store["...key"]` writes — if no step writes anything, there's
  nothing to skip on resume. Add `writes=` to the steps whose
  outputs the rest of the pipeline depends on.
- **Side effects that aren't crash-safe to repeat.** A failing
  step is retried as-is on `resume=True`; an external HTTP POST
  with no idempotency key may run twice. Gate with idempotency
  keys, deduplication, or a marker write before the side effect.

## Example

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

from lazybridge import Agent, LLMEngine, Plan, Step, Store


class ValidationReport(BaseModel):
    rejected_rows: list[int]
    accepted_rows: int


def extract_data() -> str:
    return "..."


def transform_records(raw: str) -> str:
    return "..."


def load_warehouse(clean: str) -> None:
    pass


extract = Agent(engine=LLMEngine("claude-opus-4-7"), name="extract")
transform = Agent(engine=LLMEngine("claude-opus-4-7"), name="transform")
validate = Agent(engine=LLMEngine("claude-opus-4-7"), name="validate", output=ValidationReport)
load = Agent(engine=LLMEngine("claude-opus-4-7"), name="load")


# 1) Crash-resume across runs.
store = Store(db="pipeline.sqlite")


def build_plan() -> Agent:
    return Agent(
        engine=Plan(
            Step("extract",   writes="raw"),
            Step("transform", writes="clean"),
            Step("validate",  writes="verdict"),
            Step("load",      writes="loaded"),
            store=store,
            checkpoint_key="etl-2026-04-30",
            resume=True,
        ),
        tools=[extract, transform, validate, load],
    )


# Run 1 — crashes during validate. status="failed", next_step="validate".
try:
    build_plan()("today's batch")
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass

# Run 2 — resumes at validate. extract + transform are NOT re-run.
build_plan()("today's batch")

# Run 3 — plan is "done"; short-circuits and returns cached kv.
result = build_plan()("today's batch")
print(result.payload)   # {"raw": ..., "clean": ..., "verdict": ..., "loaded": ...}


# 2) Concurrent fan-out runs with on_concurrent="fork".
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor


backtest = Agent(
    engine=Plan(
        Step(load_data,    name="load",  writes="prices"),
        Step(run_strategy, name="run",
             task="Execute the strategy; emit a trade log.",
             writes="trades"),
        Step(score_run,    name="score",
             task="Compute Sharpe and max-drawdown."),
        store=store,
        checkpoint_key="backtest",
        on_concurrent="fork",          # each run gets its own keyspace
    ),
    tools=[load_data, run_strategy, score_run],
)
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=8) as pool:
    list(pool.map(backtest, ["AAPL", "GOOG", "MSFT", "AMZN"]))


# 3) Inspecting partial state after a failure.
state = store.read("etl-2026-04-30")
print(state["status"])           # "failed"
print(state["next_step"])        # "validate"
print(state["completed_steps"])  # ["extract", "transform"]
print(state["kv"]["clean"])      # the partial result
```

## Pitfalls

- **Changing the Plan and resuming from an old checkpoint will
  fail.** The saved `next_step` may no longer exist. After
  refactoring steps, delete the checkpoint:
  `store.delete(checkpoint_key)`.
- **Non-JSON-serialisable `writes=` values are stringified.** The
  Store JSON-encodes via `json.dumps(default=str)`; a file handle
  becomes its `repr(...)`. Prefer primitives, dicts, and Pydantic
  models (`.model_dump()`-friendly).
- **Resume does not re-inject `session=` or exporters.** Pass the
  same `session=` + `store=` on every run — the Plan only
  persists what's behind the `Store` interface, not the live
  observability wiring.
- **A failed parallel band points the checkpoint at the band's
  *first* step.** The whole band re-runs cleanly so all sibling
  `writes` are produced consistently — resuming mid-band would
  leave earlier branches' Store keys stale relative to the re-run
  ones.
- **`on_concurrent="fork"` + `resume=True` is a configuration
  error.** Fork mode gives each run its own key, so there's no
  shared checkpoint to resume from. The framework raises
  `PlanCompileError` at construction.
- **`ConcurrentPlanRunError` is a runtime error, not a compile
  error.** Two processes opening the same SQLite file with the
  same `checkpoint_key` and `on_concurrent="fail"` collide via
  CAS; the loser raises. Catch it explicitly if you want graceful
  retry-after-backoff semantics.
- **Cached "done" runs still cost the storage round-trip.** A
  short-circuited run returns instantly but still hits the Store
  to read the cached kv. For very high read rates, layer your
  own in-process cache.
